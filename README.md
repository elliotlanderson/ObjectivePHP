# ObjectivePHP
Creating classes for datatypes in PHP to make everything object oriented.

## Notes (Jun 27, 2016)
I think I made this after being offended when someone told me PHP wasn't a valid language because it was functional and the 
syntax was wild.  Also clearly had a very limited knowledge of what composer was and certainly had no idea about psr-4 autoloading.
